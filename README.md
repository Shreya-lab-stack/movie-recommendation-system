# Movie Recommendation System

This project contains two types of recommendation systems built using Python:

1. *Content-Based Filtering* – Recommends movies based on genre similarity using TF-IDF and cosine similarity.
2. *Collaborative Filtering* – Recommends movies based on user-item interaction using the Surprise library (KNNBasic).

## How to Run
Use Google Colab or Jupyter Notebook. Steps are clearly marked in each notebook.
